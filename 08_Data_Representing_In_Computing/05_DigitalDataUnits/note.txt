The difference between SI and IEC units mostly comes down to how they define units of data size, like kilobyte (KB), megabyte (MB), etc. Here’s a simple breakdown:

📏 SI (International System of Units)
Based on powers of 10
Common in general computing, storage devices (like hard drives), and networking
Unit	Prefix	Value in bytes
KB	    kilo	1,000 bytes
MB	    mega	1,000,000 bytes
GB	    giga	1,000,000,000 bytes
TB	    tera	1,000,000,000,000 bytes


🧮 IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)
Based on powers of 2
Common in programming, operating systems, and memory (like RAM)
Unit	Prefix	Value in bytes
KiB	    kibi	1,024 bytes
MiB	    mebi	1,048,576 bytes (1024²)
GiB	    gibi	1,073,741,824 bytes (1024³)
TiB	    tebi	1,099,511,627,776 bytes (1024⁴)
