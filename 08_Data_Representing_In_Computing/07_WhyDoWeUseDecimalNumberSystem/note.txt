ðŸ§  Why Humans Use Decimal (Base-10)
1. We Have 10 Fingers ðŸ¤šðŸ¤š
The most widely accepted reason is that humans naturally started counting on their fingers.
We have 10 fingers, so early humans grouped numbers in tensâ€”making base-10 feel intuitive and natural.

2. Historical Momentum ðŸ“œ
Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans used base-10 systems.
Once writing, trade, and math developed around base-10, it stuck around.
It became the standard in education, science, and commerce, reinforcing its use over generations.

3. Simplicity in Arithmetic âž•âž–
Decimal math is relatively simple for humans to learn and perform mentally or on paper.
It balances large-enough groupings (10) with manageable single-digit symbols (0â€“9).
