---> xxd 
xxd is a command-line utility commonly used on Unix-like systems (like Linux and macOS) to create a hex dump of a file or standard input. It can also reverse a hex dump back into the original binary form.

---> xxd -b file_name
The xxd -b command shows the binary representation of each byte in the file instead of the default hexadecimal format.

---> UTF-8
UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) is a character encoding standard used to represent Unicode text in computers and on the internet. Itâ€™s the most widely used encoding today because it's efficient, compatible with ASCII, and supports every character in the Unicode standard â€” which includes symbols, letters, and emojis from almost every language in the world.

Key Points:
-Variable length: Each character takes 1 to 4 bytes.
-ASCII characters (like a, 1, !) are just 1 byte.
-More complex characters (like â‚¬, æ¼¢, ðŸ˜Š) take 2â€“4 bytes.
-Backwards-compatible with ASCII: Any valid ASCII file is also valid UTF-8.
-Efficient for English: Since ASCII characters are 1 byte, UTF-8 is space-efficient for English and similar languages.
-Widely supported: Used in web pages, programming languages, and databases.
-In short, UTF-8 is a smart, flexible way to encode all the world's text in a format that computers can understand and share.
