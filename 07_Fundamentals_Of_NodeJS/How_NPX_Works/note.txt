---> What NPX dose?
= It searches for a file and executes it

*****Steps of how searching works on NPX-

Search-step-1
    Searches for package.json in current working directory
    Searches for name key in the json
    Searches for bin key in the json 

Search-step-2 (If package.json is not present in current directory)
    Searches for node_modules folder in the current working directory
    Searches for .bin folder 
    then it finally looking for hello named folder in the .bin folder (if we run npx hello in terminal)
    and finally executes it

Search-step-3 (If json and node_modules both are not present in the current working directory)
    Searches for hello in global npm folder
    If find then executes it

Search-step-4 (if it is not found in global npm folder)
    it will go to npx cache to find hello package
    if found then executes it

Search-step-5 (if it is not found in global npm folder and npx cache)
    it will go to npmjs.com to find hello package
    Prompts to install the package if found
    Downloads and install
