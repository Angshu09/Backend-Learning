---> In Node.js, NPX (Node Package Execute) is a command-line tool that comes with npm (starting from version 5.2.0) and allows you to execute Node.js packages directly without needing to install them globally. It simplifies the process of running temporary or one-time commands by downloading and running the specified package on the fly, ensuring you always use the latest version. For example, npx create-react-app my-app runs the create-react-app package without requiring prior installation, making development faster and more efficient.

---> The npx-cli.js file is the main executable script behind the npx command-line tool, acting as its entry point when run in the terminal. It uses Node.js to parse command-line arguments, resolve packages from local or global node_modules, and fetch packages from the npm registry if needed. It then executes the corresponding binaries using Node.js’s child_process module, handles errors, and cleans up temporary installations after execution. Its core functionality simplifies package execution without global installation, making it essential for managing on-demand Node.js utilities.

---> The npm-cli.js file located at C:\ProgramFiles\nodejs\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js is the core executable script for npm (Node Package Manager) in a Node.js installation. When you run npm commands in the terminal, the system invokes this file using the Node.js runtime. During installation, Node.js adds its installation directory to the system’s PATH environment variable, allowing you to execute npm from any directory. Internally, running npm triggers Node.js to execute npm-cli.js, which processes commands like installing packages, managing dependencies, and running scripts. If the PATH variable isn’t set, you can run npm by explicitly using the full path to the file.
