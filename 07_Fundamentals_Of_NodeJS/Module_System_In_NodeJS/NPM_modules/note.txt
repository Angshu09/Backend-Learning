---> What is path and what is package 
A path in computing refers to the location of a file or directory in a filesystem. It can be absolute (starting from the root, e.g., /home/user/file.txt in Linux or C:\Users\User\file.txt in Windows) or relative (based on the current directory, e.g., ./file.txt). In Node.js, the path module is used to work with file and directory paths.

A package in Node.js is a collection of JavaScript files, modules, or libraries that help developers add functionality to their projects. Packages are usually managed using npm (Node Package Manager) and come with a package.json file that defines dependencies, scripts, and metadata.


---> What are dependencies
Dependencies are external packages or modules that a Node.js project requires to function properly. These are managed using npm (Node Package Manager) and are listed in the package.json file.


---> What is package.json file 
package.json is the configuration file for a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, including:
Project name, version, and description
Dependencies (packages required for the project)
Scripts (commands to run the project)
Author and license information
This file helps npm manage the project efficiently.

---> Why package.json is important 
Manages Dependencies – Lists required packages, ensuring consistency in installation and version control.
Defines Project Metadata – Stores project name, version, description, author, and license.
Enables Custom Scripts – Allows automation of tasks like starting the server, testing, and building.
Ensures Project Consistency – Helps maintain the correct versions of dependencies for all users.
Supports Version Control & Collaboration – Makes it easy to share and set up the project without including node_modules/.
