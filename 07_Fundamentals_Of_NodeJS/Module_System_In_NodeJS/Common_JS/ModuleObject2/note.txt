1. What is module.isPreLoading
module.isPreloading is a Boolean property introduced in Node.js v20.6.0 that indicates whether the current module is being preloaded using the --require (-r) command-line flag. When a module is loaded normally with require(), it is false, but when preloaded, it is true. This allows conditional execution of code, such as enabling debugging logs or running setup scripts only when preloading. For example, running node --require ./preload.js will set module.isPreloading to true, enabling preloading-specific logic without affecting normal imports.


2. What are logs?
Logs are records of events, messages, or errors generated by applications, systems, or services to track their behavior, performance, and issues. Logs help developers and system administrators debug issues, monitor performance, and analyze system activities.
Types of Logs --->
---System Logs – Generated by the operating system (e.g., Linux logs in /var/log/).
---Application Logs – Messages from software applications (e.g., error logs, debug logs).
---Server Logs – Logs from web or database servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx, MySQL logs).
---Security Logs – Record authentication, access attempts, and security events.
